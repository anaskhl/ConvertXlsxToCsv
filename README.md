# Convert xlsx to csv
Converts any xlsx sheet to csv file  in utf-8 format. Microsoft excel does not save csv file in utf-8 format which makes it difficult to read charecters which are not english. 

We can use other tools for that like google sheets, but it has limits as if the file is big, it won't work.

# Required Environment / Minimum Setup

  - python 2.7

# Configuration

Who do I speak with to get the values for configuration files?

## Run the script:
- install python 2.7 and add it to the system path
- install the dependencies
- run the following command: python ConvertToCsv.py
- The tool will give instructions to complete the tasks
